# Project Milestone 1

This assignment is focused on coming up with a group and a problem space for your project.

**Submission Details**

- Group Member Names
    - Your group must be no more than 3 people
        - most groups should be 2 or 3 people
        - if you want to work alone, you will have to demonstrate why it is important / necessary (e.g. access to confidential research data).
    - A team name (so we have something to call your group in Canvas - this can be changed later)
- Problem Space
    - What is the problem you would like to solve? Try to describe it in terms of ML.
    - Why is this an important and interesting problem? What triggered the idea?
    - A description of why it would be useful to use / develop machine learning to solve this problem.
- Data / Data Plan
    - A description of your data.
        - What are some of the interesting or critical features you have?
            - Are there any features you plan to exclude?
        - What are the outcome variable(s) or other expected kinds of results from your project?
            - Is it supervised or unsupervised?
        - Approximately (or exactly) how many samples do you have?
        - This entry must include whether you already have the data
            - if you don't already have access to your dataset you must discuss how you plan to have the data by the time you give your official pitch (Milestone 2).
