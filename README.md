### Predicting Home Credit Default Risk
We are attempting to create a ML model that analyzes a Loan Applicant's available data to determine how likely they are to repay their debt responsibly. This problem is based on a past Kaggle competition, [found here.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data)

The output of the model will be a float between 0 and 1, a continuous problem.
The dataset provided has a vast quantity of features to examine/analyze. We will most likely simplify the problem space initially, and expand if possible.
Standard application data is provided; Applicant background, credit history, payment history.

Why is this an important and interesting problem? What triggered the idea?
A description of why it would be useful to use / develop machine learning to solve this problem.
Data / Data Plan
A description of your data.
What are some of the interesting or critical features you have?
Are there any features you plan to exclude?
What are the outcome variable(s) or other expected kinds of results from your project?
Is it supervised or unsupervised?
Approximately (or exactly) how many samples do you have?
This entry must include whether you already have the data
if you don't already have access to your dataset you must discuss how you plan to have the data by the time you give your official pitch (Milestone 2).
